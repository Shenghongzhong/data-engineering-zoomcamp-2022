## Motivation

Having graduated from a 6-month data science bootcamp, I wrote a message at our #14-alumni-lounge to ask **"What are you thriving for?"**. 
Unfortunately, I got no answer. 

Thriving means making progresses every single day. We spent 600+ hours in assignment, courses at bootcamp; Our level is from the beginner to somewhere-between-intermediate&expert level data scientists. Some of folks from my cohort are doing deep learning, others are getting jobs as data analysts. However, I just feel that it isn’t satisfying. I still remembered back in those days I learned lectures on the weekend, and spent tremendous time in understanding lectures during the week. I enjoyed solving those problems and writing Python codes as a newbie. ( than writing CSS codes if honestly).

The ability of planning to executing is more important. Up to a point, I believe I'm capable of planning for stuff I love to learn. But 

-[] Here I think there are some inconsistency between logics. Why is it important to write this ability of learning stuff here for motivation? If I write " the more you practice, the more you are better at planning and executing", then so what? why is this motivating to me to learn DE? it seems irrelevant.

first and foremost it’s starting with WHY. I've seen many people fail because they never put thoughts into constructing reasons. 

> "an hour of thinking about what you want saves decades of work"


As far as I’m concerned, statistics is a missing puzzle to me, especially for verbal reasoning and numerical reasoning. Because I don’t want to be the donkey - check donkey problem. This got me to think actually my priority isn’t really developing technical skills rn, but skills in English and communication and project management skills.
